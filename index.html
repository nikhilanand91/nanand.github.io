	I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/"> McGill University</a>, funded primarily by the <a href="https://bootstrapcollaboration.com/"> Simons Collaboration on the Nonperturbative Bootstrap</a>. I did my PhD at Johns Hopkins University where my advisor was <a href="https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/">Jared Kaplan</a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley.</p>

<h2>
	Research Interests</h2>

I am interested in using numerical and analytical methods to understand strongly coupled quantum field theories. Since late 2020, I have also become extremely interested in machine learning research. I am currently thinking about how neural networks learn - and forget - information, and how/why they generalize.

	<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09730">Nonperturbative dynamics of (2+1)d ϕ4-theory from Hamiltonian truncation </a>
	(with Emanuel Katz, Zuhair U. Khandker, Matthew T. Walters; 78 pages).
	This work continues the lightcone Hamiltonian truncation program into 2+1 dimensions by studying the RG flow of the free scalar to the three-dimensional Ising model. We computed the spectrum and correlation functions of several local operators along the full RG flow and demonstrated universal behavior in the IR consistent with the 3d Ising CFT. This work required addressing a major conceptual hurdle of Hamiltonian truncation -- that of state-dependent counterterms -- that had previously limited Hamiltonian truncation studies to dimensions strictly less than three. Relatedly, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08405">this work </a> by Elias-Miró and Hardy  addressed this issue in a setting complementary to that of lightcone Hamiltonian truncation.

	<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13544">Introduction to Lightcone Conformal Truncation: QFT Dynamics from CFT Data
 </a>
	(with A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Emanuel Katz, Zuhair U. Khandker, Matthew T. Walters, Yuan Xin; 199 pages).
	We further developed the 1+1 dimensional lightcone Hamiltonian truncation program to encompass QFTs whose RG flows originate from <i>any</i> free theory with fermions, gauge fields, and scalars. Beyond several new analytic methods which greatly increased the dimensionality and efficiency of our basis and matrix elements, we also presented several results for a 1+1 dimensional Yukawa theory, 1+1 dimensional QCD, and extended our previous work to higher truncation cutoffs. Finally, we developed an extensive <a href="https://github.com/andrewliamfitz/LCT">set of publicly available Mathematica tools</a>, allowing users to experiment with their own RG flows and to study a large class of 1+1 dimensional strongly interacting QFTs.

	<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02573">Momentum space CFT correlators for Hamiltonian truncation
 </a>
	(with Zuhair U. Khandker, Matthew T. Walters; 39 pages).
	We lay some groundwork for doing lightcone Hamiltonian truncation in d>2. In particular, we consider Lorentzian CFT Wightman functions in momentum space and derive a set of reference formulas for computing two- and three-point functions when the middle operator has zero spatial momentum.
